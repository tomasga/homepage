![Tomasz Gawłowski](/images/tom.png)

This is my first homepage I ever done. Web page is in polish and english language, with menu positioned always on top of the page. Content is switched using java script. I was trying to use BEM convenction in project. In js code functions are used, to reduce using global variables. I hope you'll enjoy.
